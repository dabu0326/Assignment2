#Assignment introduction

###1.network/graph data source
We found that the network map is very suitable for representing character relationship, then we + observed the relationship between the characters in many areas, including movies, novels, 
television drama, finally we choose The Outlaws Of The Marsh , the characters in the story of 
intricate relationships with the network map is very clear. In order to understand the 
relationships between the characters, we use Internet to search large amounts of data. the 
network map of our making feature is that each node represents a character in the story, each 
character's name with text labels, when the mouse moved to a character node, displays all the 
relationship of the current character, the network map can also display each character's 
nickname.


###2.methodology
First, we study the HTML and JavaScript, then we analysis a large number of examples of d3.js 
code. We started making network of our own after learned of SVG and mechanical map production 
Methods. In making our own network map process, first of all,we put the characters and the 
relationship into The JSON data, then see each character as a node, the node connection of the  + nodes are the relationship with the corresponding text description, we also capture mouse  
movements, when the mouse moved to a node and leave a node, it will produce different effects  
that a node will display or hide some information.

###3.findings
After the working practice, we learned how to work as a team, how to better use of our own 
advantages of division of labor, at the same time we have a more thorough understanding of 
JavaScript and d3.js, also can use the language to do some fun things. After the tasks are 
completed, we generate more interest on the course of Information Visualization,and see its 
usefulness, it can make the seemingly no regular information into a coherent information, at the + same time as a web page with a convenient form of circulation.
