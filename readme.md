#Family Relationships visualizition 
### A brief introduction of our work.
What we have done is to visualize the relationships between people in a family. 
The basic relationships in family including the relationships between man and wife, parents and children, brothers and sisters, uncle and nephew, which including some complicated network relationships. 
In our visualization tools, we use a dot to represent a person, a line between dots to represent the relationships between them, which will make it very clear to see the relationships in one family.

### Data resource.
[kinship.data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/kinship/kinship.data)
The first source data shows the relationship between everyone. Each relationship is represented as relationship (character A, character B). 
There are not any lists of people and there are some parts that are redundant (such as not only does the relationship father (A, B) exist but also the relationship son (B, A) exists).
